MyApplication - Java GUI Utility Program
MyApplication is a simple Java-based GUI program that demonstrates the use of JOptionPane to provide a user-friendly interface for performing basic operations like arithmetic calculations, even/odd number checks, shopping discount calculations, and student grading information. This application serves as an excellent introduction to Java GUI programming and handling user inputs.

Features
Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of user-input numbers.
Even or Odd Checker: Determine if a given number is even or odd.
Shopping Discount Calculator: Calculate discounts based on the total shopping amount with multiple discount levels.
Student Grading Information: Capture and display basic student details (name and age).
Exit Option: Allows users to exit the application gracefully.
How to Run the Application
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that JDK 8 or higher is installed.
IDE or Command Line: You can use any IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) or run from the command line.

Program Flow
The program starts with a welcome message and a menu offering five options:

Arithmetic Operations
Even/Odd Number Check
Shopping Discount Calculator
Student Grading Information
Exit
Based on the user's selection, specific operations are performed:

Arithmetic Operations: Users can input numbers and choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Even/Odd Check: Users input a number to check if it's even or odd.
Shopping Discount: Calculates discounts based on the total shopping amount with multiple tiers.
Student Grading: Users input the student's name and age to display the information.
Exit: Terminates the program.
Code Structure
Main Class: Application.java
Contains a while loop to continuously prompt the user until they choose to exit.
Error handling using try-catch to manage invalid input scenarios.
Error Handling
Handles incorrect input types using a NumberFormatException catch block.
Provides user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs like non-numeric values or division by zero.
Validates negative inputs where applicable (e.g., shopping amount, age).
Future Improvements
Add more validation to handle edge cases (e.g., large inputs).
Introduce advanced GUI frameworks like JavaFX for better UI design.
Refactor the code to be more modular by separating logic into methods or classes.
Add unit tests for better reliability.
